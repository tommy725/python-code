Create my own voice :
--------------------

To add new voices to Tortoise, you will need to do the following:

Gather audioclips of your speaker(s). Good sources are YouTube interviews (you can use youtube-dl to fetch the audio), audiobooks or podcasts. Guidelines for good clips are in the next section.
Cut your clips into ~10 second segments. You want at least 3 clips. More is better, but I only experimented with up to 5 in my testing.
Save the clips as a WAV file with floating point format and a 22,050 sample rate.


Create a subdirectory in voices/
Put your clips in that subdirectory. 
I left in My Github several sample wav files

Run this :

python tortoise/do_tts.py --text "Hi, Lets go to the park , and play basketball" --voice Eran --preset fast
