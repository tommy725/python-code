Moby-Dick or, the Whale
Herman Melville uses the narrative of a sailor, Ishmael.
He is on board with Captain Ahab who is trying to exact revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale that bit off his leg at the knee.
For those who didn’t study the tale in high school—or couldn’t make it through the 135 chapters—critics say it really is worth a read. 
Some refer to it as the American Bible, better approached after becoming an adult and not as a student in high school.
